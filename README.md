# Archiver

Currently working to add pkzip support.
objectives are as follows:
1. read uncompressed/unencrypted pkzip files
2. write uncompressed/unencrypted pkzip files
3. add at least 1 decoder (compression) and read decoded files
4. add the coresponding encoder then write encoded (compressed) files.
5. add a decrypter to decrypt some simple encryption scheme
6. add an encrypter to encrypt some encryption scheme
7. repeat 3,4 or 5,6 until full encryption and compression spec is incorperated
8. begin other archive scheme (like tar, 7zip, .iso, or rar)
